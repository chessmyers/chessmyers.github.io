      description: `Loot was born out numerous iterations of an idea that started out as an app for arranging item exchanges and transactions among college students. After realizing there was no need to limit the user base in this way, we began thinking about ways we could design an e-commerce experience that would make it easy to use and promote spontaneous purchases.

Eventually we came up for the idea of an app that shows users products in a continuous stack of cards which would allow them to swipe in one of three directions to indicate their feeling about the product. If they swipe left on the product, that indicates they do not like it. Swiping right indicates they do like the product and want to add it to a "wish list" they can go back to later. Swiping up on a product adds it to their shopping cart, which then allows them to easily purchase it, as well as anything else added to the cart, on the next screen. This system of shopping allows for a continuous stream of user information and preferences to be collected, analyzed, and used to refine which products to show to which users.

This project won us the Best UX/UI Design and Best Use of Moltin API awards at this hackathon. We were then able to meet with the Moltin staff at their office in downtown Boston to describe our app idea to them. There are currently no plans to continue developing this project, but the experience was extremely valuable.`,

      description: `The NU Co-op Search (NU pronounced as "new") is a project that aims to reinvent the way students search for co-ops at Northeastern University. Every semester, students return from their co-op experiences and complete a form for their advisers that includes many questions about their overall experience on the co-op. This form is then used solely within the sphere of the co-op advisers and perhaps for some statistical analysis; but, for the most part, this valuable information is kept private from NU students searching for their own co-ops.

The goal of the NU Co-op Search, which in its current state acts more of a proof of concept than a concrete beginning to the project, aims to be a new place for students to submit reviews of the co-ops they've worked. As reviews come in, the system uses the IBM machine learning API to generate an aggregate rating of each company based on a combination of the word sentiment and numerical ratings from each review. The form also includes questions about company culture and professionalism that can help prospective employees determine if the company is a good fit for them.

      My teammate and I entered this hackathon with the goal of working on a project using only technology that both of us were completely new to or had limited experience with. After attending the various workshops throughout the day and exploring the hardware room, we decided we wanted to build something that would require both a Particle Argon and a web app using Flask and a SQL database.

      Any user can ask the Magic 3 Light a question through our web interface, and the Particle Argon will sequentially pulse, slot-machine style, and create suspense until it stops on one of the three lights, which represent yes, no, or maybe. The information is then displayed on the website and added to a log of all of the questions and answers.

      We started building this project by adding the 3 LED lights to the Particle Argon circuit board. Then, we coded the lighting sequence for the particle in Arduino. We utilized Flask to build our web interface and used http post requests to transfer the information between our particle and web app.
